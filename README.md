#### Featured technologies
1. [Angular4](https://angular.io/):- Angular is a platform that makes it easy to build applications with the web. Angular combines declarative templates, dependency injection, end to end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development challenges
2. [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/):- An open-source JavaScript run-time environment for executing server-side JavaScript code.
3. [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/):- TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing to the language
4. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/):- Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications, whether on laptops, data center VMs, or the cloud.
5. [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/):- Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications
6. [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/):- Jenkins is an open source automation server written in Java. Jenkins helps to automate the non-human part of the software development process, with continuous integration and facilitating technical aspects of continuous delivery.
7. [IBM Application Security ](https://www.ibm.com/ae-en/marketplace/application-security-on-cloud):- IBM Application Security on Cloud is a cloud app security offering that helps secure your organization's Web, cloud, mobile, and other applications. It detects dozens of today's most pervasive security vulnerabilities and enhances your application security.
8. [Aqua Micro Scanner](https://github.com/aquasecurity/microscanner):- Aqua Security's MicroScanner lets you check your container images for vulnerabilities. If your image has any known high-severity issue, MicroScanner can fail the image build, making it easy to include as a step in your CI/CD pipeline.
9. [Docker Cloud](https://cloud.docker.com/):- Docker Cloud is the name of the new cloud service by Docker that expands on the features of Tutum, brings a tighter integration with Docker Hub, and provides new updates and fixes
10. [Github](https://github.com/):- GitHub Inc. is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It is mostly used for computer code
